Q: What are the charges for international roaming and how do I enable it?

Q: What should I do if I'm getting charged for services I didn't order?
A: Contact our billing department immediately at 1-800-BILLING or through secure message in your online account.

Resolution typically takes 3-5 business days, and credits appear on your next bill.
