- pip package manager
- OpenRouter API key (for LLM access)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-kural
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API keys**
   - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file
   - Add your OpenRouter API key:
     ```toml
     [secrets]
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
     ```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Launch using the command above
2. **Enter User ID**: Provide a unique identifier for conversation tracking
3. **Choose Input Method**: Use voice recording or text input
4. **Interact**: The AI will respond with appropriate persona and provide helpful assistance
5. **Voice Response**: Listen to AI responses in the detected language

## 🎭 Persona Adaptation

The system automatically adapts its communication style based on detected sentiment:

- **Negative Sentiment**: Empathetic de-escalation approach
- **Positive Sentiment**: Efficient and friendly interaction
- **Neutral Sentiment**: Professional and direct communication

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not working**: Ensure microphone permissions are enabled
2. **API errors**: Verify OpenRouter API key is correctly configured
3. **Model loading slow**: First-time Whisper model download may take time
4. **Memory issues**: Restart the application if conversation history becomes corrupted
